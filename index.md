# About
I'm currently an Applied Scientist at Amazon AWS Fundamental Research Team, working on LLMs and agents. Before that, I was a PhD student in Data Science at New York University advised by Yann LeCun and Kyunghyun Cho. During my PhD, I was also a visiting researcher at Meta AI Research from October 2022 to October 2024.
I'm broadly interested in representation learning, world models, planning, reinforcement learning, and autonomous vehicles.

Before, I completed my undergrad at the University of Warsaw in Poland. I also have extensive industry experience from doing internships at
at Google, Nvidia and Jane Street.
