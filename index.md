# About
I'm an n-th year PhD student in Data Science at New York University advised by Yann LeCun and Kyunghyun Cho. 
I'm also currently a visiting researcher at Meta AI Research.
I'm broadly interested in representation learning, world models, planning, reinforcement learning, and autonomous vehicles.\
**I'm on the job market!**

Before, I completed my undergrad at the University of Warsaw in Poland. I also have extensive industry experience from doing internships at
at Google, Nvidia and Jane Street.
