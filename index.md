# About
I'm a 3-rd year PhD student in Data Science at New York University advised by Yann LeCun and Kyunghyun Cho.
I'm interested in self-driving, model-based reinforcement learning, self-supervised pre-training and unsupervised exploration in RL.

Before this I completed my undergrad at the University of Warsaw in Poland,
and did internships at Google, Nvidia and Jane Street.
